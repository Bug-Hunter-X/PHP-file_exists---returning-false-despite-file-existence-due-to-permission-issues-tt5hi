This code suffers from a potential issue where the `file_exists()` function may return `false` even if a file exists, but the script doesn't have sufficient permissions to access it. This is particularly common when dealing with files in shared hosting environments or when file permissions aren't properly configured.

```php
<?php
if (file_exists('/path/to/file.txt')) {
    // Process the file
    echo 'File exists.';
} else {
    echo 'File does not exist.';
}
?>
```
