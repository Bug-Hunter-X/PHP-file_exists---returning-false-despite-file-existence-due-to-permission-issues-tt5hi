# PHP file_exists() Permission Issue

This repository demonstrates a common PHP error where `file_exists()` returns `false` even if a file exists, solely due to permission problems.  The code example showcases the problem, and the solution provides a more robust way to check file existence while accounting for permissions.

## Problem

The `file_exists()` function in PHP checks for the existence of a file. However, it doesn't explicitly check for permissions. If the script doesn't have read access to the file, `file_exists()` might incorrectly report that the file doesn't exist.

## Solution

The solution involves a more comprehensive approach, possibly using a combination of `file_exists()` with additional permission checks, or employing error handling to catch exceptions related to file access. The solution demonstrates how to approach this properly.
